    "\n",
    "In order to understand software written for frameworks like HIP, CUDA, and OpenCL, we need to have a rudimentary grasp of the C++ language. While C++ is the language of choice for many real-world scientific applications, it can be more complex to understand than plain C, and that extra complexity may get in the way of the science. This course is designed to impart just enough \"Survival C/C++\" in order to be productive with scientific computing. It also aims to deliver fundamental information such as how numbers are represented in binary. Topics to be covered are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Making code understandable with comments\n",
    "* Statements and code blocks\n",
    "* Understanding how integers and floats are represented\n",
    "* Using functions\n",

    "* Performing math operations\n",
    "* Using flow control such as **if** statements and **for** loops\n",
    "* Using memory allocations as arrays\n",

    "## Statements and code blocks\n",

    "\n",
    "Bits (1's or 0's) are the fundamental data type in computing. Everything else is represented using an arrangement of bits.

The bits that make up a floating point number are laid out in three sections: a **sign bit**, an **exponent**, and a **mantissa**. The sign bit occupies one bit, the exponent has **NBE** bits and the mantissa has **NBM** bits. The total number of bits for a floating point number is then NBE+NBM+1. The **exponent** **(E)** is just an unsigned integer created by a dot product of the exponent bits with a vector of decreasing positive powers of 2, ranging from $2^{\\mathrm{NBE}-1}$ to $2^0$. The mantissa is constructed the same way, but the value is $2^{0}==1$ plus the dot product of the mantissa bits with a vector of decreasing powers of 2 ranging from $2^{-1}$ to $2^{-\\mathrm{NBM}}$. All three components combine together to form the value, as shown below."

    "## Reading and writing data to files\n",
    "\n",
    "There are much better ways to write binary data to files, using self-descriptive and cross-platform formats like [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/). Sometimes though you might be stuck and just need a quick way to get your data in and out of your program for **testing and verification purposes**. Within the C subset of the C++ language there is a simple way to read and write binary data, using the endian representation that your architecture supports. You just have to be aware that this data may not be portable to other architectures without accounting for differences in Endianess, so **please** don't use these methods for actual production code.\n",

    "\n",
    "where the string **fname** is the file name and **mode** determines how the file is opened. A pointer to a **std::FILE** object is returned by **std::fopen**. There are two main modes to access a file, text mode and binary mode. Linux and Windows systems differ in how to represent a new line, on Windows a new line means '\\r\\n', whereas on Linux it means '\\n'. Opening a file in text mode means lines are read and written in an OS-specific way. Opening a file in binary mode means that everything is read or written **as is** from the file, and no special interpretation is applied to new line characters. Here are the main modes useful for working with files:\n",

Aside from a few lines of example code, the main function of this program is to write out a binary file for an image of 32-bit floats of size (NROWS_C=4, NCOLS_C=6). Every pixel contains the dimension 0 coordinate multiplied by the dimension 1 coordinate. The program has a couple of memory errors, and one of them is causing the program to crash. Your job is to find these errors using **std::printf** and the GNU debugger GDB.\n",

    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open [image_creator.cpp](image_creator.cpp) and have a look to see what the file is doing.\n",
    "1. Open a terminal and use **cd** to navigate to the **src/L0_Survival_C++** directory.\n",
    "1. Type **make clean** and then **make** (on Linux) to make the program **image_creator.exe**. Notice that we changed the makefile to compile with flags \"-g -O0\". This enables debugging symbols and turns off all optimisations that might hide code. We could also have compiled the source file directly by typing\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "g++ -g -O0 image_creator.cpp -o image_creator.exe\n",
    "``` \n",
    "1. Run the program ```./image_creator.exe``` to verify that it crashes.\n",
    "1. Run the program with GDB using the command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gdb ./image_creator.exe\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Now within gdb type ```run```\n",
    "to start the program. It will execute until it crashes\n",
    "1. We suspect that the program is running off the end of the array. The coordinates **i0** and **i1** should be in the range (0,0)-(3,5). Set a conditional breakpoint using the command ```break image_creator.cpp:66 if ((i0>3)&&(i1>5))```. Then the program will stop if **i0** and **i1** misbehave.\n",
    "1. Use the command ```run``` to execute again until it hits the break point. You can run the command ```n``` to step through the lines of code, and the command ```print``` to print variables.\n",
    "1. Type ```print i0``` to check the contents of **i0**. Does this value make sense?\n",
    "1. Type ```del``` to clear all breakpoints.\n",
    "1. Modify **image_creator.cpp** to use a **std::printf** (or a **std::cout**) statement to print the value of **i0** for each iteration of the outermost loop (line 66). After you change the source you can type ```make``` from within the GDB window to make the program and type ```run``` to run the code again. Why do you think **i0** is exceeding the size of the array allong dimension 0?\n",
    "1. Have a look at how **i0** is being generated in the outermost loop. Hopefully the bug will become known at this point. Make the required fix to **image_creator.cpp**.\n",
    "1. You can run the **make** command within GDB to re-build the program after changes are made. \n",
    "1. Type `run` to run the code again. Does the error still occur?\n",
    "1. Within **gdb** type ```del``` to remove all breakpoints and then type ```quit``` to quit the program.\n",
    "1. Run program without gdb to see if the program runs successfully."

Your task is replace the two lines of code for **offset_A** and **offset_B** in the kernel, so that the matrix multiplication is correct with no crashes and a maximum error of around 0. We compile and run the code using this line below."
